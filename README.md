# How real is it?
I guess you are wondering if these numbers are real, short answer: they are not.

The idea of this neuron counter came to me after reading an article about cells in English class which stated that humans lose 100k neurons a day. I thought then that it might be cool to make a real-time neuron counter based on your date of birth.

## Neurons lost per day
I did some research and came to the conclusion that science still does not know how many cells we really lose per day. That is why I chose the number from this [article](http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~meeklesr/neurons.html) as 200k is very visual. I also read that humans do not start to lose neurons until they are
 around 20 year old. I am not sure wheter that is true so I avoided code this extra complexity into the counter.
I understand this statement means that while you grow up, you create new neurons that compensate (or maybe increase) your neural count, but once you stop growing your neuron count starts decreasing.

## Should I worry?
You really shouldn't! It turns out that the number of neuron cells does not determine your intelligence but, their connections do. Also, if you do the match, you are probably going to die before losing a significant amount of neurons (9% after 100 years using the numbers of the counter).

## How many neurons are we really born with?
Science used to think we had 100 billion, but in the last 10 years they are now considering an average of [86 billion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19226510/). 
Science does not seem to know much about brains, so even if your count is lower, no one knows what that means.
I know that mathematically it does not make sense to start with a round number like 86B and then compute in real time your personal count with a precision of 1 unit, but as I said earlier the counter is supposed to be fun, not accurate.
I also added an intelligence adjustment (which is 100% baloney) to compensate for those smart ones :)
